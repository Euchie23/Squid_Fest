🧪 Heavy Metals Analysis: ICP-MS Workflow

📅 Sample Preparation

Sample Type: Squid tissue (lyophilized and powdered)

Digestion Protocol:

100 mg of tissue extracted using 5 mL of HNO₃:HCl (1:3 v/v)

Sonication for 1 hour @ 25°C

Centrifugation: 3,200 rpm for 10 min

Dilution: 100x with 2% HNO₃

🔬 Instrumentation (link here for instrumentation)

ICP-MS: Agilent 7700e

Standards: Multi-element standard IV + Hg standard


Calibration:

External calibration curve via linear regression

Intensity averaged from triplicate runs


⚖️ CRM Validation (put link here)

CRM Used: NIST CRM 1566b (Oyster Tissue)

Elements Validated: Metal_A, Metal_B, Metal_C, Metal_D, Metal_E, Metal_F, Metal_G, Metal_H, Metal_I

Uncertainties & Certified Values: See CMF Table in Appendix (put link here)

Recovery Calculation:

_Recovery Rate = (Measured Value / Certified Value) * 100_

⚡ LOD & LOQ Calculation (put link here)

Based on: Bretnall & Clarke (2011)

Equation:

LOD: _LOD = IB + 3 * (SB * 0.01 * IB)_

LOQ:  _LOQ = IB + 10 * (SB * 0.01 * IB)_

Where:

 _IB_ = Mean blank signal

 _SB_ = Std deviation of blank

LOQ/LOD tables available in Appendix Tables S1 & S1.1 (put link here)


🌐 Notes

Calibration performed per batch; only one representative curve included

Thallium (Tl) not validated due to absence in CRM

Blank subtraction applied to all sample concentrations


🔄 Recommendations

Consider compound-specific standards or spike recovery studies for elements not included in CRM

Address possible over-recovery in Pb and Hg analyses
