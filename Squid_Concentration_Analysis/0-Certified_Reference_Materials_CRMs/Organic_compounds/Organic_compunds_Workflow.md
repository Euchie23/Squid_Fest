💊 Organic Compounds Analysis: LC-MS/MS Methodology

📅 Sample Preparation

Sample Type: Lyophilized squid tissue, ground to powder

Extraction Protocol:

100 mg tissue + 1.5 mL EDTA (45 mM) + 4 mL ACN (2% HOAc)

Internal Standard: 100 μL of Cholic acid-d4 (250 ppb)

Vortex 10 min → Sonicate 50 min → Centrifuge 10 min @ 3,200 rpm

Filter using Oasis PRiME HLB SPE tube

Dry under high vacuum, redissolve in 1 mL 40% CAN

Protocol modified from Giulivo et al., 2016 and Patriarca et al., 2020


🔬 Instrumentation (put link here)

LC-MS/MS Models: TripleQuad 5500 & QTRAP 5500 (Sciex)

LC Systems: Exion LC & Agilent 1260

Chromatography:

Column: ACQUITY UPLC® CSH C18, 100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm

Column oven: 40°C; Injection volume: 2–5 μL depending on setup


📊 Calibration & Quantification (put link here)

Calibration Curve: External, 1/x weighted linear regression

Triplicate measurements used for intensity

No LOD Calculated: Detection based on peak observation at target RT

LOQ Tables: See Appendix Table S2


⚖️ Method Validation (put link here)

No CRM Available for target compounds in squid tissue

Proposed Method Source: Feo et al. (2020), validated for water/sediment

Results Interpreted Relatively, not absolutely quantified

Validation Metrics Pending: Spiking experiments and recovery testing not completed at this stage


🚫 Limitations

Without CRM or matrix-matched spike recoveries, values must be treated with caution

Method demonstrates reproducibility, but accuracy remains unverified


🔄 Recommendations

Future work should include:

Spike-recovery experiments using authentic standards

Matrix-specific CRM acquisition if commercially available

Full validation (LOQ, precision, recovery, reproducibility) in marine tissue
