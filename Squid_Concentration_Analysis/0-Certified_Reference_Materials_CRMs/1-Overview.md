🧪 Methodology Validation: CRM for Trace Metals & Organic Compounds in Squid Tissues 🦑🌊

🎯 Objective

This project investigates the contamination of squid tissues by trace metals ***(essential and toxic elements)***  and organic compounds. The methodologies employed include ICP-MS for trace metals and LC-MS/MS for organic contaminants. Certified Reference Material (CRM) validation and method reproducibility assessments were performed where possible to ensure data reliability.



📆 Project Structure

📁 Trace_Metals_ICP-MS analysis using NIST CRM 1566b for metals coming from multiple sources like Al, As, Se, Mg, V, Pb, Th, etc. 
-Includes digestion protocol, calibration setup, and recovery calculations.
*** For confidentiality reasons the trace metals used in the actual study will be anonymized and will therefore be represented by generic names (e.g Metal_A, Metal_B, etc) going forward***

📁 Organic_Compounds_LC-MS/MS analysis for emerging contaminants from different industries like Amiobenzoic Acid (leisure) and Metolachlor(Agriculture) etc. 
-No CRM used, but literature-based validation steps are discussed.
*** For confidentiality reasons the organic compounds used in the actual study will be anonymized and will therefore be represented by generic names (e.g Organic_A, Organic_B, etc) going forward***

📁 Appendix contains, from the methodology section, for both trace metals and organic compounds:
	-Instrument parameters 
	-Calibration curve outline (ONLY TRACE METALS)
	-Certified mass fraction tables (ONLY TRACE METALS)

🔄 Recommendations for Future Work

📊 CRM Acquisition for organic compounds to support direct quantification in biotic matrices.

🔎 Re-check Recoveries: Some heavy metal recoveries (e.g., Metal_H, Metal_I ) were unusually high and need reassessment.

🧪 Complete Validation: LOQs, LODs, and precision metrics should be calculated for organic compounds using matrix-matched spiked experiments.
