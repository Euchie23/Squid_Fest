# üìä Method Validation for Organic Compounds

The analytical methodology proposed for the determination of organic compounds‚Äîspecifically adipic acid, ibuprofen, caprolactam, and chlorpyrifos‚Äîwas adapted from the validated protocol outlined by FEO et al. (2020), which originally targeted pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants in water and sediment matrices. This adaptation was necessitated by the lack of a single, cost-effective certified reference material (CRM) encompassing all the organic compounds investigated in this study. Furthermore, significant differences in sample matrix composition‚Äînamely, squid tissue versus aquatic matrices‚Äîposed additional challenges. As a result, comprehensive method validation could not be completed within the timeframe of this research.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation Status and Limitations

Spiking experiments and recovery calculations were intended to be performed as part of the validation process. However, these experiments are still ongoing, and the necessary data to calculate full recovery rates, limits of quantification (LOQs), and precision (relative standard deviation, RSD) have not yet been obtained. As a result, the method validation remains incomplete. This limitation is primarily due to time constraints following the conclusion of the study, which prevented continuation of the experimental work.

The method was adapted based on the guidelines set out by FEO et al. (2020), where recovery rates were determined by spiking water and sediment samples with known analyte concentrations. In this study, the approach has been transferred to squid tissue, but corresponding validation data are still awaited.

## üöÄ Future Work

A complete validation of the analytical method, including the calculation of recovery rates, LOQs, and RSDs for the targeted small organic compounds, will be essential in future research. Obtaining this data will strengthen the method‚Äôs reliability and suitability for marine contamination studies.
