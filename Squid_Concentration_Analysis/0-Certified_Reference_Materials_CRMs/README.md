## 🧪 Methodology Validation: CRM for Trace Metals & Organic Compounds in Squid Tissues 🦑🌊 <br><br>

### 🎯 Objective <br>
This project investigates the contamination of squid tissues by trace metals **(essential and toxic elements)**  and organic compounds. The methodologies employed include ICP-MS for trace metals and LC-MS/MS for organic contaminants. Certified Reference Material (CRM) validation and method reproducibility assessments were performed where possible to ensure data reliability. <br><br>

### 📆 CRM Details <br>

📁 Trace_Metals_ICP-MS analysis using NIST CRM 1566b for metals coming from multiple sources like Al, As, Se, Mg, V, Pb, Th, etc. <br>
Includes digestion protocol, calibration setup, and recovery calculations. <br>
\*\*\***For confidentiality reasons the trace metals used in the actual study will be anonymized and will therefore be represented by generic names (e.g Metal_A, Metal_B, etc) going forward***\*\* <br>

📁 Organic_Compounds_LC-MS/MS analysis for emerging contaminants from different industries like Amiobenzoic Acid (leisure) and Metolachlor(Agriculture) etc. <br>
No CRM used, but literature-based validation steps are discussed. <br>
\*\*\***For confidentiality reasons the organic compounds used in the actual study will be anonymized and will therefore be represented by generic names (e.g Organic_A, Organic_B, etc) going forward***\*\* <br>

### ⚗️ Summary of Method Validation <br>
#### 🧲 Trace Metals <br>
- **CRM Used**: NIST CRM 1566b (Oyster Tissue) <br>

- **Matrix**: Squid tissue (lyophilized & acid digested) <br>

- **Instrument**: ICP-MS (Agilent 7700e) <br>

- **Quantification**: External calibration using multi-element standards <br>

- **Recovery Assessment**: CRM-certified values used to evaluate accuracy. More Details <br>


#### 💊 Organic Compounds <br>

- **CRM Not Available**: No compound-specific CRM for squid tissue <br>

- **Analytes**: Organic_A, Organic_B, Organic_C, Organic_D <br>

- **Method Source**: Adapted from Feo et al. (2020) <br>

- **Instrument**: LC-MS/MS (TripleQuad/QTRAP 5500) <br>

- **Validation Status**: Literature-based method; internal standard used. More Details <br><br>

### 🔄 Recommendations for Future Work<br>

- **📊 CRM Acquisition**: To support direct quantification and methodology validation in biotic matrices for organic compounds. <br>

- **🔎 Re-check Recoveries**: Some trace metal recoveries (e.g., Metal_H, Metal_I ) were unusually high and need reassessment. <br>

- **🧪 Complete Validation**: LOQs, LODs, and precision metrics should be calculated for organic compounds using matrix-matched spiked experiments. <br>
