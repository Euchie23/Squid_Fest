## 🧠 Data Mining 🧬📊🧪

### Overview 🎯  
This stage involved a range of exploratory and statistical techniques to extract meaningful patterns, test hypotheses, and uncover ecological or biological insights from pollutant concentration data. Analyses were performed across various biological and environmental variables, focusing on how factors such as gender, size, year, and tissue type influence pollutant distributions in squid.

The Folder includes: <br>
- **Size-Based Correlation Analysis**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Spearman correlation tests examining the relationship between squid size (categorized by mantle length) and pollutant levels.

- **Gender Temporal Comparison**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Comparative statistical tests evaluating pollutant differences between genders across and within years. Outputs include boxplots and summary tables.

- **Tissue-Wise Temporal Regression Modeling**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Regression models tracking the impact of maturity, geography, and other variables on concentrations over time.

- **Multivariate & Machine Learning Approaches**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* PCA, RDA, clustering, and other techniques to uncover hidden structures and interactions in the data.

- **Visualization Outputs**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Boxplots, correlation heatmaps, PCA biplots, and classification plots summarizing patterns and findings.

### 🎓 Skills & Techniques Demonstrated

**🔍 Biological Pattern Detection**  
Learned how to use correlation analysis to test hypotheses about pollutant accumulation across biological size classes and how imputation choices affect results.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Spearman correlation tests were run to examine whether squid size (categorized by mantle length) influenced pollutant levels, analyzing both filtered and imputed datasets to assess sensitivity to BLOD/BLOQ values.

**📊 Comparative Analysis**  
Gained experience applying statistical tests to assess pollutant differences by gender, uncovering biologically relevant temporal trends.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Comparative statistical tests (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis, t-tests, ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilks, Mann-Whitney) evaluated pollutant differences between male and female squid across and within years.

**📅 Temporal Modeling**  
Used linear regression models to assess how variables such as gender, month, latitude, distance to land, and maturity influenced pollutant levels across years and tissues, using plots to illustrate trends and evolving relationships over time.

**🧮 Multivariate Analysis & Classification**  
Applied PCA to visualize patterns in metal and organic datasets. RDA explored pollutant interactions per tissue, while correlation plots and PLS analyses investigated compound synergies. K-means clustering and decision trees were used to classify tissue types based on compound profiles.

**📈 Communicating Results Visually**  
Strengthened data storytelling through reproducible, publication-ready plots that clearly summarized key insights across analyses.
