## ⚖️ Human Health Risk Assessment 🧍🍽️🦑

### Overview 🎯  
This stage evaluates the potential health risks associated with consuming **Illex argentinus**, a cephalopod species that forms a growing part of global seafood diets—particularly in South America and Asia. Given the bioaccumulative nature of toxic contaminants in marine organisms, this module estimates **daily human exposure levels** to metals and organic compounds via squid consumption. Using pollutant concentration data, country-specific consumption rates, and oral reference doses (RfDs), **Estimated Daily Intakes (EDIs)** and **Hazard Quotients (HQs)** were calculated for both average and high-exposure scenarios. The work integrates toxicological benchmarks with real-world dietary behavior to assess human risk.

### 🎓 Skills & Techniques Demonstrated  

- **📉 Toxicological Risk Quantification**  
  Estimated dietary exposure levels using population-specific intake models.  
  * Calculated EDIs using pollutant concentrations, annual consumption rates, and body weight data from Argentina and Taiwan.  
  * Derived Hazard Quotients (HQ = EDI / RfD) to assess exceedance of safe intake thresholds.

- **🧮 Quantitative Modeling & Custom Formula Derivation**  
  Adapted and implemented published risk equations for cephalopod-specific dietary scenarios.  
  * Formulas customized from existing frameworks (Sala et al., 2022) to integrate local consumption and landings data.

- **🌍 Interdisciplinary Integration of Environmental and Public Health Data**  
  Combined environmental pollution data, fishery statistics, and toxicological references into a unified risk model.  
  * Pulled data from multiple international and national sources (FAO, US EPA, Ministry of Health, etc.).

- **📊 Percentile-Based Exposure Scenarios**  
  Assessed variability in population risk by calculating both mean and 95th percentile exposure values.  
  * Enabled insights into both typical and high-risk consumption behaviors.

- **📚 Research & Literature Synthesis**  
  Incorporated RfDs from peer-reviewed studies and government agencies for metals and organic compounds.  
  * Recognized knowledge gaps where oral reference doses were unavailable, documenting limitations transparently.

- **💬 Communication of Scientific Uncertainty**  
  Framed risk estimates in terms of relative exceedance, consumer exposure levels, and regulatory thresholds to aid interpretation by non-specialist stakeholders.
